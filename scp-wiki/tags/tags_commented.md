<h1>
On 19th May, 2022 Wikidot servers have been hit by hackers.
</h1>
<h2>
All traces lead to Russian Federation.
</h2>
<p>
<b>All the data (files and database) are intact and no data loss has occured.</b>
</p>
<p>We are planning to bring Wikidot <b>back on Monday</b>. It takes a bit longer than we first anticipated because we are literally re-installing the whole infrastructure to make sure hackers left no backdoors. At the same time we are updating most of the critical software too!
<p>
<b>Thank you for your patience and we humbly ask for some more</b>. It's been a very difficult day for us and it's far from over, so keep your fingers crossed!
</p>
<p>
I will keep you posted on this page.
