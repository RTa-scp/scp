<title>Wikidot servers hacked</title>

<h1>
On 19th May, 2022 Wikidot servers have been hit by hackers.
</h1>
<h2>
All traces lead to Russian Federation.
</h2>
<p>
Because we did not know how the hackers got into our servers nor how much of our infrastructure had been compromised, we had to move very carefuly.
</p>
<p>
At the time of this writing we have regained access to all our resources and we are gaining ground, but we still need to examine all servers and configuration before re-enabling Wikidot.
</p>
<p>
<b>All the data (files and database) is intact and no data loss has occured.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>Thank you for your patience and we humbly ask for some more</b>. It's been a very difficult day for us and it's far from over, so keep your fingers crossed!
</p>
<p>
I will keep you posted on this page.
